                        <h1>Politican Quotes</h1>
                        <p>Politician Quotes is my final project for CS 4300: Language and Information.
                           The app analyzed a large corpus of political texts, including debate transcripts,
                           speeches, and tweets to discover similarities and differences in political speech 
                           among politicians in the United States. I worked on this project as part of a 
                           team of four, with my role emphasizing the UI, front-end visuals, and small pieces
                           of the back-end. We used HTML, CSS, and some Javascript for the front-end, and python
                           for the back-end. We used VS Code for IDE and git for version control.

                           a project I undertook on my own in the summer of 2019 to hone my skills
                           in web development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I developed this site
                           using Visual Studio Code for an IDE, and Git for version control, and
                           it is hosted using Github pages. I also personally designed and constructed
                           almost every icon and image on this site using Microsoft Publisher.

                        <p>This project was completed with a group of three other students in 
                           the functional programming class CS 3110. This was an open project in the
                           sense that students were free to pursue virtually any idea and were given 
                           no starter code, so we built the whole game from scratch. The game features
                           every aspect of the game of Monopoly, including support for up to four players,
                           rent, jail, houses and hotels, chance and community chest cards, and a colorful
                           board that updates with every roll. The game is played in the Linux terminal.

                        <p>This project was completed with a group of three other students as part of
                           the functional programming class CS 3110. The project is a text adventure game
                           similar (in style but not scale) to the "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" text game,
                           played in the Linux terminal by typing commands. The player is meant to travel 
                           around Cornell's campus finding items and keys used to unlock doors in Gates
                           Hall, the main CS building on campus. The engine was created using OCaml and the 
                           game data using a JSON file. VS Code was used for an IDE and Git for version control.

                                CS 3410. The project consists of a virtual circuit constructed using the 
                                program Logisim. The end result is a CPU that can read nearly every 
                                instruction in the MIPS assembly language, including arithmetic calculations, logical
                                operations, storing to and loading from memory, and access to 32 registers. 
                                The CPU is pipelined in 5 stages, increasing efficiency and overall speed.
                                In this way, the CPU is a functional model of a real CPU that could be utilized
                                by a modern computer.

                           CS 2110. The challenge of the project was to devise an efficient and effective
                           algorithm for a sapceship to travel the edges of a graph with nodes represented by
                           planets, each of which has a known number of gems. The spaceship has a finite amount
                           of fuel and must gather as many gems as possible and return to earth without running
                           out of fuel. Ultimately, my algorithm, which compared the number of gems that would be gained
                           by traveling to every unvisited planet within fuel range of earth, was among the 
                           most effective for many randomly generated graphs.
